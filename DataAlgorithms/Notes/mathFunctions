Common Math Functions

need to know a baseline of math to understand efficiency of code


constant function
f(n) = 1

Linear function
f(n) = n

 ^^ what you give this function you give this function
 you give back the same thing
 
2^5 = 2*2*2*2*2 = 32
^exponentiation 

log2^32 = 5

log2^16 = 4

log is the opposite of exponentiation

log10^1000 = 3

f(n) = log(n)

Large Growth

Polynomial function

f(n) = n^2
quadratic is a squared function
cubic and quadtratic funtions belong to the same family 
of quadtratic functions

Exponential function

f(n) = 2^need

^^ form of a constant C raised to the raised to the Nth power

Factorial operation

4! = 4*3*2*1
3! = 3*2*1
n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)
