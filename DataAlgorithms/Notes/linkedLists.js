// Property: Tail
// Description: The last node in the list

// Property: Length
// Description: The number of nodes in the listl the list's length.

// Data being tracked by a particular Linked List does not live inside the 
// linked list instance itself. 

// Node instances track important properties as well

// Linked List Node Properties:

// Property: Value
