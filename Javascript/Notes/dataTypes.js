// JavaScript Data Types
// Before we start manipulating data, we first have to know what kinds of data we can manipulate. JavaScript has 6 data types:

// 5 Primitive Types:
// Numbers
// String (text)
// Boolean
// Undefined
// Null
// and objects.

NaN
// Stands for Not-A-Number
// It's a propert of the global object and is not a JS data type
// NaN is the result of any illegal numerical operations

// Falsey vs. Truthy

// In Ruby the only falset values are nil and false

// In Javascript, zeros, empty strings, undefined, null, 
// Nan are all considered falsey values, everything else is true

// Primitives vs. Objects

// A primitive type is data that is not an object and cannot have methods
// This is different from Ruby where everything is an object 

// In Javascript, numbers are primitives and do NOT have object methods

// It's important to understand not just the syntactic differenc between the two examples
// You also need to understand the fundamental difference between
// how two languages represent data:

// In Ruby everything is an object
// Whereas in JS there are primitive data types that are not objects

// JS Objects
