// JavasScript OAA notes (review)

// Browser receives HTML to render
// Also gets some script code, which it starts executing(JS)
// script changes what we see on the screen, plays videos, sends request(AJAX)

// JavaScript was written in 10 days for Metscape 2
// originally named Mocha
// submitted in 1997 to ECMA for consideration as an industry standard
// standardized version: ECMAScript

// Why the name JavaScript?
// compliment to Java Applets for little animations
// vaguely similar syntax to Java
// lightweight and simple: no classes, no integers
// not for professionals

// AJAX became popular in the 2000s
// websites can send.receive data to/from server in background
// demand for richer apps on browser
// Faster performance became necessary

// Node developed in 2011 to allow us to write JS on back end
// Since June 2015, current version is ECMAScript6(ES6)


// JS Object is the equivalent as a Ruby Hash 

// JavaScript runs in 2 main environments:

// the browser;
// and server-side.

// JavaScript's genesis comes from the browser;
//  it was designed by Netscape to add dynamic code inside Netscape
//  Navigator. JavaScript code was traditionally run by the user's 
// browser, not the server.

// In this respect, it was used very differently than Ruby. 
// Programmers didn't write stand-alone JavaScript programs
//  (initially there wasn't a javascript my_script.js command 
// like ruby my_script.rb), nor was there a REPL (no irb or pry). 
// There are other differences rooted in JS's history as a browser
//  language that can make it frustrating for general use.

// In recent years, there has been interest in bringing JavaScript 
// to the server. Node.js is a server-side JavaScript framework 
// which allows programmers like us to run JavaScript from their terminals.
//  Our first JS programs won't feature the web browser at all; 
// they'll be a repeat of our first Ruby scripts.

// In Javascript, an expression is a line of code that returns a value. A statement is any line of code
// Every expression needs a semi-colon at the end. Statements that aren't expressions
//  don't generally require semi-colons, and may cause syntax errors.

// Curly braces are used to delineate code blocks such as in function 
// definitions, loops, and if blocks. Curly braces can also 
// be used to define JavaScript objects.

// Mathematical Operators
// +
// -
// *
// /
// %

// Comparison Operators
// >
// <
// >=
// <=
// ===
// !==




// Logical Operators
// &&: and
// ||: or
// !: not

// String Methods
// String.prototype.toLowerCase
// String.prototype.toUpperCase
// String.prototype.indexOf
// +: concatenation


// Array Methods
// Array.prototype.pop
// Array.prototype.push
// Array.prototype.unshift
// Array.prototype.shift
// Array.prototype.indexOf
// Similar to Array#index in Ruby, but returns -1 when it does not find an item.
// []
// Index using bracket notation (similar to Ruby).
// Array.prototype.slice([start, [end]])
// Makes a copy of an array from the start index up to but 
// not including the end index. Both arguments are optional (the first and last elements are used by default).
// Array.includes (ES6+)
// Identical to Array#include? in Ruby
// Array.isArray(ES6+):

// Class method that accepts one argument and returns a boolean 
// representing whether it is an Array.
