// JavasScript OAA notes (review)

// Browser receives HTML to render
// Also gets some script code, which it starts executing(JS)
// script changes what we see on the screen, plays videos, sends request(AJAX)

// JavaScript was written in 10 days for Metscape 2
// originally named Mocha
// submitted in 1997 to ECMA for consideration as an industry standard
// standardized version: ECMAScript

// Why the name JavaScript?
// compliment to Java Applets for little animations
// vaguely similar syntax to Java
// lightweight and simple: no classes, no integers
// not for professionals

// AJAX became popular in the 2000s
// websites can send.receive data to/from server in background
// demand for richer apps on browser
// Faster performance became necessary

// Node developed in 2011 to allow us to write JS on back end
// Since June 2015, current version is ECMAScript6(ES6)


// JS Object is the equivalent as a Ruby Hash
